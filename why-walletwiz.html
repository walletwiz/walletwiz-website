                <h2>Zero-Based Approach</h2>
                <p class="pt-4">
                    At WalletWiz, we take a zero-based approach to financial literacy education. This means that our beginner courses start…well…right from the beginning. Most people who aren’t exposed to the world of finance through work, or other personal experience typically have little to no knowledge about Canadian personal finance systems, and this is why our courses start from scratch. You do not need to have any prior knowledge to begin your journey with us, but as you go through it you will find yourself closer and closer to achieving financial wellness.
