                <p class="pt-4">
                    WalletWiz aims to teach financial literacy from a zero base perspective. This means that our beginner courses start…well…right from the beginning. Most people who aren’t exposed to the world of finance through work, personal experience etc. typically have little to no knowledge about Canadian personal finance systems, and this is why our courses start from scratch. You do not need to have any prior knowledge to begin your journey with us, but by the time you complete it, you will be financially literate.

                <h2 class="pt-6">One Stop Shop</h2>
                <p class="pt-4">
                    Our goal is to be your one stop shop for financial literacy, which is why we have a 24/7 online training facility for your convenience. Our online portal allows you to take a variety of courses and access additional material so you can continue your pursuit of becoming financially literate even after an in-class session. With new material being added regularly, “MyWallet” is an excellent way to help you stay ahead!
