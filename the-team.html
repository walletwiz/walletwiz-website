                <h2>Raj Raman</h2>
                <p class="text-muted">Founder and CEO</p>
                <p class="pt-4">
                    Raj Raman is a passionate educator, speaker and entrepreneur. Since he began working as a music instructor at the age of 14, he has been passionate about extra-curricular education. At the age of 18, he was hired by a major Canadian bank as one of their youngest advisors. While working at the bank, Raj realized that many of his clients had large gaps in their financial knowledge - which prevented them from being able to make important financial decisions and ultimately led to a lower quality of life for them. This is where he realized that there is a significant need for financial literacy education in Canada.

                <p class="pt-4">
                    This realization led Raj to start WalletWiz, an organization that aims to help Canadian students become financially literate â€“ so they can start making sound financial decisions right from their first earned dollar.

                <p class="pt-4">     
                    Raj is passionate about spreading the message that financial wellness is just as important as physical wellness. In his spare time, Raj enjoys playing a variety of instruments including piano, drums and guitar. He is also an avid fan of basketball and the Toronto Raptors.
